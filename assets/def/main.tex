\section{Introduction}

URL shortener systems are used to create tiny URLs that will redirect to actual URLs.
The main reason for their existence is to create shorter addresses that are \textbf{easier to remember} and \textbf{easier to share} like in tweets or SMSes.
Some examples are \href{https://yun.ir/}{yun.ir} and \href{https://zaya.io/}{zaya}. Please go ahead and test their websites.

\section{Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Given a URL, the service should generate short URL.
  \item When accessing a short URL, the service should redirect to the original address.
  \item Users should have the option to pick their custom short URL.
  \item Short URLs should be expired at some time. Users should be able to specify the expiration time.
  \item Users should be able to check how many times their short URL is used.
\end{enumerate}
